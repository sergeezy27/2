## Introduction

*The Weeknd* is a Canadian singer who initially gained fame by posting his mix tapes online. He has since become a critically acclaimed musician and Grammy Award winner.[^1] I was introduced to *The Weekend* through his song *The Hills* in middle school, but since I've fallen in love with the magical, somber sound of albums ***Kiss Land*** and ***After Hours***.

Fans, such as myself, often see ***Kiss Land*** as a precursor to ***After Hours*** due to their shared dark, cinematic R&B sound, while critics regard ***After Hours*** as a more polished, superior work.[^2]

Differences in opinion and my personal perception motivate me to determine whether the two albums are similar. I aim to test whether the mean `energy`, which reflects dynamics, loudness, and intensity, is the same between the two albums:

-   Null hypothesis: The mean energy levels of ***Kiss Land*** and ***After Hours*** are equal.

-   Alternative hypothesis: The mean energy levels of ***Kiss Land*** and ***After Hours*** are different.

I also want to conduct exploratory analysis on the following key attributes:

-   `danceability`: reflecting the suitability for dancing, a key factor in pop.

-   `valence`: a measure of how positive a track sounds, reflecting the prominence of melancholy in his music.

## Energy analysis

```{r}
#| label: data cleaning

albums <- c("Trilogy",
            "Kiss Land",
            "Beauty Behind The Madness",
            "Starboy",
            "My Dear Melancholy,",
            "After Hours",
            "Dawn FM")

the_weeknd_sm <- the_weeknd %>% 
  select(album_name, track_name, energy, danceability, valence) %>% 
  filter(album_name %in% albums) %>% 
  mutate(album_name = factor(album_name, levels = albums))

main_albums <- the_weeknd_sm %>% 
  filter(album_name %in% c("Kiss Land", "After Hours"))

after_hours <- the_weeknd_sm %>% 
  filter(album_name == "After Hours")
```

```{r}
#| fig-alt: Different boxplots of energy for each album and EP of The Weeknd.
#| label: energy boxplot

ggplot(the_weeknd_sm,
       aes(x = album_name,
           y = energy,
           fill = album_name)) +
  geom_boxplot(show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Dark2") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) + #https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rotating-and-spacing-axis-labels-in-ggplot2-in-r/
  labs(title = "The Weeknd album energy",
       x = "Album name",
       y = "Energy")
```

The boxplots show a slight trend of increasing `energy` with each album release, but ***Kiss Land*** deviates, presenting the highest median `energy`. This aligns with *The Weeknd*’s view of the album as his most honest and vulnerable.[^3] Median-wise, ***Kiss Land*** is closer to *My Dear Melancholy,* than ***After Hours***, supporting critics who suggest that tracks from *My Dear Melancholy,* could fit well into ***Kiss Land*** without disrupting its style.[^4] To compare the means between the albums of focus, a **two-sample t-test** is required.

![Kiss Land album cover](kiss_land.jpg)

```{r}
#| label: two-sample t-test

t.test(energy ~ album_name, data = main_albums)
```

After conducting the test, it resulted in a p-value of **0.2052**. Such a high p-value indicates no significant difference in energy levels between ***Kiss Land*** and ***After Hours***. We fail to reject the null and draw no further conclusions.

## Valence and danceability analysis

```{r}
#| label: average tables

the_weeknd_summary <- the_weeknd_sm %>% 
  group_by(album_name) %>% 
  summarise("Average energy" = round(mean(energy), 3),
          "Average valence" = round(mean(valence), 3),
          "Average danceability" = round(mean(danceability), 3)) %>% 
  rename("Album name" = album_name)
gt(the_weeknd_summary)
```

On average ***After Hours*** appears lower in all three attributes, and the most similar to ***Kiss Land***. *My Dear Melancholy,* does not appear to be as similar as ***After Hours***. 

![After Hours album cover](after_hours.jpg){width="600"}

```{r}
#| fig-alt: A scatter for After Hours showing the danceability and valence of each track.
#| label: After Hours scatter plot

ggplot(after_hours,
       aes(x = valence,
           y = danceability,
           color = track_name,
           label = track_name)) +
  geom_point(show.legend = FALSE,
             size = 4) +
  geom_text_repel(size = 3,
                  nudge_x = 0.05,
                  nudge_y = 0.02,
                  segment.color = NA) + #https://rdrr.io/cran/ggrepel/man/geom_text_repel.html
  scale_color_viridis(discrete = TRUE) + # Dark2 doesn't have enough colors
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Danceability vs valence for After Hours",
       x = "Valence",
       y = "Danceability") +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 0.82)) #https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/scale_continuous.html
```

In ***After Hours***, `danceability` is higher in happier, upbeat tracks. For example, *Save Your Tears* has a groovy baseline and fast tempo, increasing both `danceability` and `valence`, while *Until I Bleed Out* is slower with dragged vocals, lowering both values.

#| message: false

#| label: two album scatter plot

ggplot(main_albums,
       aes(x = valence,
           y = danceability,
           color = album_name,
           size = energy)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.85) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "black") +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Key attributes of Kiss Land and After Hours",
       x = "Valence",
       y = "Danceability",
       color = "Album name",
       size = "Energy") +
  scale_size_continuous(range = c(3, 10)) +
  guides(size = guide_legend(override.aes = list(linetype = 0))) #https://aosmith.rbind.io/2020/07/09/ggplot2-override-aes/
```

```{r}
#| label: energy table

the_weeknd_danceability <- main_albums %>% 
  group_by(album_name) %>% 
  summarise("Least danceable song" = track_name[which.min(danceability)],
            "Least danceable energy" = energy[which.min(danceability)],
            "Most danceable song" = track_name[which.max(danceability)],
            "Most danceable energy" = energy[which.max(danceability)]) %>% 
  rename("Album name" = album_name)
gt(the_weeknd_danceability)
```

Looking at the scatter plot, `danceability` and `valence` seem correlated, but `energy` doesn’t correlate with either variable. This is supported by the observation that `energy` for the most and least danceable songs in ***Kiss Land*** is not significantly different. Both albums have similar `valence` and `danceability` distributions, though ***After Hours*** has more melancholic tracks, while ***Kiss Land*** has more danceable and mood-neutral ones.

## Conclusion

The analysis suggests ***Kiss Land*** and ***After Hours*** are similar in key attributes. Both albums likely have similar `energy` on average. While `valence` and `danceability` also appear similar, their distributions differ. Further exploration of how `valence` affects `danceability` in *The Weeknd*'s music would be valuable.
